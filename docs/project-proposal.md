# Auckland Traffic Flow Analysis (Backend)

## Background and objective
- Issue
    - Commuting uncertainty caused by traffic congestion and peak-period pressure
    - Lack of unified and interpretable visual analysis for road traffic flow patterns
- Objective
    - Analyze historical road traffic flow data in Auckland
    - Provide clear and interpretable visual insights through dashboards
    - Support commuter awareness and traffic flow analysis

## Data source
- Official Auckland Transport traffic count datasets (XLSX, https://at.govt.nz/about-us/reports-publications/traffic-counts) 

## Scenarios
- Query the historical traffic flow by road or traffic monitoring site
- Get the information of traffic pressure at different times of the day (peak vs off-peak)
- Traffic volume level analysis
- Traffic flow distribution by road and time period
- Identification of high-traffic and peak-pressure locations

## MVP(Core function)
- User registration, activation, and login
- Traffic flow summary inquiry
- Traffic volume overview
- Peak period traffic analysis dashboard
